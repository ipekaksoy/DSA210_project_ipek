## Motivation of the Project 

In women's life, hysical, mental, and cognitive symptoms of menstrual cycle, significantlly affects various aspects. By studying these aspects, this project aims to increase awareness about these changes and provide important insights about women that can improve their physical and mental well-being.

## Data Source of This Data

Data for this project is extracted from a menstural cycle tracker app. App provides significant insights such as :
  * Initial and last day of menstural period
  * Physicals symptoms:_migranes, body cramps, acne and headache._
  * Mental symptoms: _anger, sadness, and mood swings._
  * Cognitive symptoms: _confusion and lack of concentration._

All these data is collected from several cycles in order to be sure about the consistency and reliability of these symptoms.

## Data Analysis:Techniques used, diï¬€erent stages of the analysis





## What I Learned about Myself In This Project?

 1.Specific alterations that have noticable impacts:
   *Physical sympthoms especially body cramps are much more intense during the menstural phase.
   * Mental sympthoms such as stres, anger and sadness peaked in lutheal phase wiht the cognitive affects such as being unable to concentrate and confussion in menstrual cycle.
 2. Life sytle such as sleeping schedule, hydration and stress affected certain symptoms.
 
 
## Limitations and Future Work
**Limitations**: 
    * Data depends only on an individual, which might inaccuraties and bias.
    * Because it only depends on an individual it might not be generalized to other people.
    * Menstrual cycle is affected by various environmental effects which cannot be determined, known (lack of knowladge about external factor).

**Future Plans **:

   * Expanding datasets with the others from other users in the app.
   * Analyze and focus on external factors more such as the diet and sleeping schedule.
   * Incorporate a machine learning system to predict the possible symptoms severity based on the history of previous cycles.
   * Creating a system which consist of more additinal variables for individuals like hormone levels and sleep quality.
